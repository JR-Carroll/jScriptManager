About:

Designed to be a wxPython experiment for housing all GIT/Python scripts.  Parse doc-strings into meaningful files for readability and instructional purposes, and then make interfaces available for use when running these scripts.  Reason being - I have LOTS of scripts that just a single script run process - with lots of instructions built-in and plenty of automation, but Im losing track of them all!  Figured this would be a good experiment into making things more manageable.
